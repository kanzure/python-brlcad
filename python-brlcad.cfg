# the order of the libraries is important, dependencies must be loaded first
libraries: bu, bn, brep, rt, wdb, ged

# defaults for each library are (bn as example):
# bn-lib-name: libbn
# bn-module-name: brlcad._bindings.libbn
# bn-lib-headers: bn.h
# You can force include individual entries from not listed headers (this ones are now included with rtgeom.h):
# rt-include-pattern: rt_.*_internal

# You only need to explicitly specify parameters which don't fit the pattern.
# An example is the rt library which has special header name (and now includes rtgeom.h too):
rt-lib-headers: raytrace.h, rtgeom.h, nurb.h
# another example is libbn which needs to include symbols from vmath.h too:
bn-lib-headers: bn.h, vmath.h
# libbu includes symbols from magic.h:
bu-lib-headers: bu.h, bu/magic.h, bu/malloc.h, bu/str.h, bu/vls.h, bu/list.h
# these symbols would be pruned otherwise, but are needed to avoid including the private __off_t later:
bu-include-pattern: off_t|struct__IO_FILE

[brlcad-7.24.0]
# You can override the default values for specific brlcad versions.

# which still covers all known versions of brlcad. Also it makes it
# easier to set up new libraries in future brlcad versions.
